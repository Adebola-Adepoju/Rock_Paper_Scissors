# Rock_Paper_Scissors
My first attempt at building a game.This game is your common Rock, Paper, Scissors Game. It describes the CPU as the Rock, Paper, Scissors ninja. There are two players, the CPU and the User. If any of the party wins, the game stops running. But if there is a tie, the game asks for user input again.
